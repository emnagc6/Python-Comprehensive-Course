# In Python, we can use multiple independent if statements to test different 
# conditions in a non-mutually exclusive manner. Unlike chained conditionals 
# (if, elif, else) that evaluate conditions in a sequence and break after the 
# first true condition, multiple if statements allow for the possibility that
# more than one condition can be true, and therefore, multiple code blocks can execute.
