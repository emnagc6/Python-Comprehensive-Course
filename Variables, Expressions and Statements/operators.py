#Operators
# + -> addition, - -> substraction, * -> multiplication, / -> division
print(1 + 1)
print(30 - 19)
print(7 * 8)
print(36 / 4) #prints a floating number
print(35 // 8) #prints quotient (floor division)
print(5 ** 2) #prints 2nd power of 5

#We must be careful about priorities
#PEMDAS Rule: PEMDAS means 1- parentheses, 2- exponents, 3- multiplication, 4- division, 5- addition, and 6- subtraction
print(2*2+2/2-2) #4+1-2 = 3.0

#Modulus operator returns mod of operation
print(5 % 2) #1

#If we want to find out our number is odd or even:
print(25 % 2) #returns 1, so the number is odd
print(8 % 2) #returns 0, so the number is even

#We can use some of this operators for stings
print("hello" + "world!") #helloworld!
print("hello" * 5) #hellohellohellohellohello

#What is an Expression?
#An expression is a combination of values, operators and variables.
#Following are all legal expressions:

#x
#20
#x+20
name = " emin" #this is an expression
print(5 * name) #this is also an expression
#Everything relates to values, operators and variables are called expressions.
