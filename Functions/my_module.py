#In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name #is the module name with the suffix .py added. Modules in Python serve as a way to organize #related pieces of code into a single file. This can include variables, functions, classes, #and runnable code. They serve several purposes:

    #Code Reusability: Once a module is created, it can be imported and used in other #Python scripts and applications.

    #Namespace Organization: Modules provide a way to avoid conflicts between global #variable names by encapsulating them.

    #Program Organization: Larger programs can be split into manageable, smaller #sub-programs or modules.
